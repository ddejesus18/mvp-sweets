<h1> MVP-Sweets</h1>

<p>MVP-Sweets is a project I started for my cousin who owns a cake shop. She would like to showcase a few of her cakes but
mainly, she wants to create an online presense for her shop. This project gives me the perfect opportunity to put a few 
new tools I would like to incorporate in my development, to use. The main tool I've been learning about is Sass, Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets.</p>

<p>The reason why I started learning Sass is because I have heard nothing but great things about it and I wanted to take the plunge. I watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz3kElLbEHE">YouTube Tutorial</a> by Derek Banas which was amazing and very detailed.<p> 

<p>I created a test project initially and played around with Sass for a bit while I watched the video and then I recreated the MVP Sweets project based off Compass & Sass. I did run into a few issues I can attribute to linking files and importing gems.</p>

Sass <strong>requires</strong> Ruby and if you download Compass, it automatically downloads Sass becuase Compass requires Sass.

<p>Another tool I would like to start using is Bootstrap. At first I was a little reluctant to use Bootstrap because of the funky design. However, after discussing with my mentor he mentioned that you can use Bootstrap for solely the grid layout which makes for reliable responsive sites. The design doesn't need to tag along.</p>
